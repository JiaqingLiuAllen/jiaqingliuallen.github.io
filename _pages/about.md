I am a PhD student in <a href='https://cse.nd.edu/'>Computer Science & Engineering</a> at the University of Notre Dame. I am advised by Dr. <a href='https://tingyucheng.com/about'>Tingyu Cheng</a>, and affiliated with the Internet of Matter Lab.

My research focuses on designing intelligent wearable systems that leverage sensors and machine learning to solve real-world problems and create new opportunities in interactive techniques or mobile health.

Previously, I earned my master's in ECE at the University of Washington, where I worked wth Dr. <a href='https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak-patel/'>Shwetak Patel</a> at the <a href='https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/'>UW Ubicomp Lab</a>. My work there centered on wearable devices and continuous, passive health sensing. I also have a background in biomedical engineering and novel material-based sensors.
